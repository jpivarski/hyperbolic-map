measured, what is left. Never rewrite or reorder past entries. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-08-05 — Planning and mathematical audit

**What.** Explored `OLD/` (the 2011–2012 Tomcat + JavaScript project and two archived disk images),
recovered the example data, audited every formula in the original code, designed the new library, and
wrote the plan (also saved to `/tmp/plan.md`).

**Why this order.** The original client is a single 1000-line file with the math, rendering, input and
networking interleaved, and its README describes the coordinate system incorrectly. Porting it without
first establishing what each formula actually computes would have baked the original's errors — and my
own misreadings — into the new code.

### Established

- **Data recovery needs no BabuDB, no JVM, no installs.** A ~40-line pure-stdlib Python `struct` parser
  reads the block files. All 137,080 records recovered, zero JSON parse failures. Details in
  `data-extraction.md`.
- **The projection math in the original is correct**, and the old README's description of it is wrong.
  The clean framing is that the data coordinates *are* SU(1,1) matrix entries and the half-angle comes
  from the Spin(2,1) double cover. See `math-audit.md` and `su11-core.md`.
- **The precision failure is real and severe.** Recentring on the far end of the dungeon data
  (`d ≈ 20`) puts a point that belongs at the disk centre on the disk *boundary* — 310 px wrong on a
  620 px canvas. Rewriting the transform core as SU(1,1) matrix products fixes it exactly.
- **Circle Limit III is the `{8,3}` tiling with the chiral `433` symmetry group**, 4 fish per octagon.
  The decisive constraint for the atlas demo: repeating identical data in every tile requires the art
  to be invariant under the tile stabiliser, which for `433` on `{8,3}` is **C₄, not C₈**. See
  `escher-circle-limit-iii.md`.
- **The dungeon maps exactly onto the binary (Böröczky) tiling** the original server already used, with
  the 442 critters occupying 399 integer `(latitude, longitude)` cells. See `tilings.md`.

### Audit outcome

Three passes. Final: **45/45 claims verified, zero corrections.** Full ledger in `math-audit.md`,
including what was verified *correct* — that file exists specifically so working code does not get
"fixed" later.

Bugs found in the original: 2 that the user already knew about (stuck drag, load-on-release) and
~18 more, of which four are genuinely mathematical:

1. `halfPlane_to_hyperShadow` returns exactly 0 near the half-plane basepoint (double cancellation).
2. `hyperShadow_to_halfPlane` divides by zero at `y ≳ 10⁴` — *inside* the dungeon's data range, and
   silently, since Java yields `Infinity`.
3. `longitudeRange` misses 45.8 % of visible cells (samples the wrong edge of each latitude band).
4. The pinch uses arithmetic means where hyperbolic midpoints are needed; the problem is actually
   exactly determined and both fingers can be pinned.

**Rejected along the way** (recorded so it is not re-attempted):

- Using `w₁w₂ − x₁x₂ − y₁y₂` as the culling test. It is only the *real part* of a complex invariant;
  error up to 19.6. It is a conservative lower bound, so it would have "worked" while over-drawing —
  the kind of bug that never announces itself.
- "Pin the hyperbolic midpoint" for the pinch. Better than the original at the midpoint but *worse*
  per finger (73 px vs 25.7 px). The exact solve dominates both.
- BFS-from-root for regular-tiling tile keys. A tile at `d = 20` sits behind ~`e²⁰` tiles.
- A bundler dependency for the IIFE build. Instead, constrain the source style and enforce the
  constraints with `tools/check-bundle.mjs`, so concatenation is a valid transform.

### Decisions taken with the user

1. Escher tiling: derive the real group and fit the art properly rather than reuse the approximate
   2012 replication.
2. Tiling is pluggable, with **both** regular `{p,q}` and the binary tiling as built-ins.
3. Cleaned-up v2 JSON schema, with a reader for the legacy shape.
4. `README.md` = API + JSON format; `docs/MATH.md` = mathematics.

### Left to do

Everything in the plan. Next: scaffolding, then fixture extraction and the legacy performance baseline
(the baseline must exist *before* any optimisation, or "faster" is unfalsifiable).

## 2026-08-05 — Step 1: scaffolding, AGENTS.md and notes/

**What.** Created `AGENTS.md` pointing at `notes/`, seeded the notes files (with `math-audit.md`
carrying the full 45-claim ledger from planning), and added `.gitignore` for `OLD/`.

**Why notes first.** The audit knowledge has no other home. It is not derivable from the code, and it
is exactly the sort of thing that gets lost between sessions — including the negative results, which
are the most expensive to re-establish and the easiest to discard.

---

## 2026-08-05 — Step 1 continued: build tooling and the SU(1,1) core

**What.** `package.json`, `tools/check-bundle.mjs`, `tools/build.mjs`, `src/core/{isom,coords,minkowski}.js`,
`src/index.js`, `test/legacy-reference.mjs`, `test/isom.test.mjs`, `test/bundle.test.mjs`.
`npm run check`, `npm test` (20 tests) and `npm run build` all pass; the bundle is 17.0 kB
(8.0 kB "minified" — whitespace and comments only).

**Zero-dependency browser bundle without a bundler.** `tools/build.mjs` topologically sorts the
import graph, strips the import lines and the `export ` keyword, and concatenates into an IIFE.
That is only a valid transform because the source style is constrained, so `tools/check-bundle.mjs`
*enforces* the constraints (single-line package-relative imports at the top of the file;
`export class|function|const|let` declarations only; no dynamic `import()`, no top-level `await`,
no cross-module identifier collisions). `export { … }` lists are permitted only in `src/index.js`,
where they are the ESM public surface, and the builder strips that block since a re-export is
meaningless in a single-scope bundle.

Rejected: taking a bundler as a devDependency. The whole point is that a consumer can `npm i` this
with no transitive dependencies and a maintainer can build it with nothing but `node`. `test/bundle.test.mjs`
evaluates the bundle in a **bare `vm` context with no Node globals**, so if the source ever reaches
for a Node API the tests fail rather than the browser.

**`test/legacy-reference.mjs` is a verbatim port of the 2011 formulas**, defects included, used as a
differential-test oracle. This is how the rewrite is *proved* behaviour-preserving instead of merely
plausible. Do not tidy that file; its value is that it is unfaithful to nothing. It also carries two
*independent* oracles (`diskDistance`, `halfPlaneToDiskDirect`) that are not ports — they are what
judge the ports.

**A real bug, caught by a test I nearly did not write.** `Isom.composeInto` had sign errors in the
`b` component: `m.b·conj(n.a)` expands to `(mbr·nar + mbi·nai) + i(mbi·nar − mbr·nai)`, and I had
both of those signs inverted. It is invisible whenever either operand is a pure rotation (`b = 0`),
which covers most obvious test cases — including the differential test against `internalToScreen`,
because `fromLegacyView` is `Rot(R)·T(B)` and the rotation has `b = 0`. Only the group-law test
(`(mn)n⁻¹ = m` with two non-trivial translations) exposed it. Noted here because the lesson
generalises: for a group implementation, test the *group laws*, not just a few evaluations.

**Checkpoint A discipline.** `src/core/coords.js` currently holds **faithful ports of the two 2011
half-plane conversions, numerical defects included**, marked as such in the file. They are replaced
with stable forms at checkpoint B, so the commit diff shows exactly what the fix is. The SU(1,1)
core itself is new code (step 2 of the plan), so the far-field precision improvement lands in A —
`test/isom.test.mjs` pins it with an assertion that the legacy polynomial *fails* the same case,
so the test would notice if someone reverted the core.

**Left to do.** Fixture extraction and the legacy performance baseline (task #2) — the baseline must
exist before any optimisation.
